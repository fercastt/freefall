# Freefall
Freefall acceleration in the solar system.
Each planet of the solar system is represented as a falling object (including Pluto :D), side by side, with their respective acceleration. Distance and size of planets to scale. Each object/planet should be the same size if you want to be precise but this way it looks cooler. You'll need a big monitor to see everything or modify the code. :-)
